## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Manual landmark input support via `processLandmarkData()` method for event-driven updates
- Export `FaceLandmarkerResult` type from main package for easier TypeScript integration
- Two input modes now supported:
  - Built-in MediaPipe detection (provide `videoElement`, call `start()`)
  - Manual updates (call `processLandmarkData()` when you have data)
- Node.js version requirement specified in `package.json` engines field (>=18.0.0)

### Changed
- `videoElement` is now optional in `AnifaceConfig` when using manual landmark input
